       <div class="center">
           <p>This program accumulates transaction data from Bitcoin's API stored in
              objects called blocks. It then generates graphs representing said data.<br>
              The following graphs model the number of blocks of transactions completed
              per hour and the number of transactions confirmed per hour for a given number<br>
              of blocks. These blocks can be mined from either the beginning or the end of
              Bitcoin's block chain as the user specifies.<br><br>
              Due to Bitcoin's limit on how many calls can be made to the API from
              an unknown IP address in a given time interval this program is limited in<br>
              the number of blocks of data it can mine at a time. Please limit blocks called to 200 or less.
              Otherwise, contact Bitcoin for permission to make a larger number of calls.<br></p>
